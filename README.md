## Overview :
Java-SnakeGame is a project of an interesting snake game, which is developed in JavaSE with Swing framework. Genrally, this snake is made up with the help of `drawArc` method and `setStroke` method to set the `Stroke` interface, as shown below:
```java
Stroke stroke = new BasicStroke(float width);
g2d.setStroke(stroke);
g2d.drawArc(int x, int y, int width, int height, int startAngle, int arcAngle);
```
And, this snake seem to move in *wave motion* with the help of changing the *startAngle* parameter of `drawArc` method, and then, repainting the `JPanel` of the ground.
